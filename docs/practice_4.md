Analysis of Existing Blockchain Networks
Objective of the Task: Research and analyze transactions, block structure, and fees in the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Binance Smart Chain blockchain networks. Students are expected to gather data from each network and prepare a report with visualizations of this data.
Expected Outcome: A report with data visualizations of each blockchain network, which includes an analysis of transactions, block structure, and fees in each network. Students should provide a comparative analysis and draw conclusions.

Steps to Complete the Assignment:
1.	Study the Theoretical Part:
    o	Learn the basic information about the blockchain networks:
        	Bitcoin: How the network works, the Proof of Work (PoW) consensus algorithm, block structure, how transactions occur, and how fees are calculated.
        	Ethereum: Features of Ethereum (e.g., the use of smart contracts, Proof of Stake algorithm, gas system for transaction calculations).
        	Binance Smart Chain (BSC): Characteristics of BSC, features of the Proof of Staked Authority (PoSA) consensus, how the network works, and how fees are calculated.
2.	Data Collection:
    o	For each network, choose tools or APIs to collect data about blocks, transactions, and fees. Use the following sources:
        	Bitcoin: Blockchain.com or Blockchair.
        	Ethereum: Etherscan for data on blocks and transactions.
        	Binance Smart Chain (BSC): BscScan for data on blocks and transactions.
Collect the following data:
o	Number of blocks per day (or month).
o	Average transaction fee.
o	Average transaction confirmation time.
o	Block sizes for each network.
3.	Analysis of Block Structure:
    o	For each blockchain, analyze the structure of blocks:
        	What data is contained in the blocks (hash, number of transactions, block time)?
        	Compare the average data size in one block for each network.
4.	Analysis of Transactions:
    o	Analyze the types of transactions in each network:
        	Simple transfers of funds.
        	Smart contracts (especially in Ethereum and BSC).
        	Token transactions (ERC-20 for Ethereum and BEP-20 for BSC).
    o	Calculate the average number of transactions occurring in blocks and their distribution by type.
5.	Analysis of Fees:
    o	Investigate how fees are formed in each network:
        	In Bitcoin, fees depend on the transaction size and network congestion.
        	In Ethereum, the gas system is used, and transaction costs depend on the complexity of the operation.
        	In BSC, fees are fixed, but they are significantly lower than in Ethereum.
    o	Compare the fees for identical types of transactions across different networks.
6.	Data Visualization:
    o	Create graphs and charts for:
    	The average transaction fee in each network (e.g., for the past month).
    	The average transaction confirmation time.
    	Block sizes and their changes over time.
    	Comparison of the number of transactions between networks.

Examples of Visualizations:
o	A graph showing the change in the average transaction fee per month for each network.
o	A diagram comparing the transaction confirmation times for each network.
o	A graph showing the change in block sizes for each network.
For data visualization, you can use Python with libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly.
7.	Writing the Report:
o	Students should write a report that includes:
1.	Theoretical Part: A description of each blockchain network, its consensus algorithm, and features.
2.	Data Analysis: Study of block structure, transactions, and fees.
3.	Visualization: Graphs and charts for comparing blockchains.
4.	Conclusions: Comparative analysis and conclusions about each network (e.g., which network is faster, which has lower fees, etc.).
8.	Preparation and Submission of the Work:
o	After completing the task, students should present a report with visualizations and a brief analysis.
o	The work should be submitted in the form of a PDF report or a presentation with graphs and diagrams.

### practice 2 - Solidity and smart-contract on ethereum

## Theory
data types (bool, int, uint) in solidity
Solidity:
- language for writing smart contract with 
- object-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart
contracts
- smart contracts are programs that govern the behavior of accounts within the
Ethereum state

## Requirements
1. Create contract in Remix IDE:
   - https://github.com/ethereum/remix-desktop/releases
   - Solidity compiler settings: compiler version-0.8.11, auto-compile, language - solidity, EVM version-default

## Results
1. Created contracts in folder practice_2
